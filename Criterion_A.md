## Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition

My client, T.L., recently opened a local restaurant named Tenzin’s Kitchen, in a town famous for sightseeing, that serves Nepalese food. Currently, he has three problems he is facing. 
First problem, he is advertising his restaurant by putting up posters in local newspapers and at the front of his restaurant. However, he finds this not impactful since it is only to be reached to local people but not tourists which the town attracts approximately 100 people per month. He is seeking a better way to promote his restaurant. 
Secondly, he struggles to organize the reservations as they record every booking on paper. As his restaurant is flourishing, it is getting difficult for him to manage all the reservations and cancellations. 
Third, at the moment, he manages both his employer information on paper which requires him to spend hours to manage his business. There are some people that already left the restaurant but are still in the list of employees, or new employees that are not being added to his list of employees which causes confusion when operating.
Lastly, he takes orders of reservations on call and records manually as he cannot afford money to employ more than 5 people. He is currently getting help from his wife, but as she is working for another job, he needs to find another way of managing reservations very soon. 

## Proposed Solution
I propose to build a GUI application to address the client’s problems considering the future users. GUI can be quickly and easily navigated. Additionally, it does not require internet connection, therefore whenever the user needs to use the product, they have the ability to do so. For a software tool to use, I propose Python. Python is the programming language that provides the open-source, in other words that it can be used by anyone as long as it is installed, and allows for the long-term viability of the system. The use of Python simplifies the potential future modifications rather than rebuilding the application again. The KivyMD will be used to create interactive well designed interfaces. SQLite is the data storage that is preferred as it allows a single codebase, it is supported on a vast range of platforms. Although there are other options such as CSV files, it is lightweight and well structured, this choice suits this project. By cooperating with Python, KivyMD, and SQLite, the solution can be used smoothly and allow sufficient applications to be made for my client.
