## Problem definition

My client, T.L., recently opened a local restaurant named Tenzin’s Kitchen, in a town famous for sightseeing, that serves Nepalese food. Currently, he has three problems he is facing. 
First problem, he is advertising his restaurant by putting up posters in local newspapers and at the front of his restaurant. However, he finds this not impactful since it is only to be reached to local people but not tourists which the town attracts approximately 100 people per month. He is seeking a better way to promote his restaurant. 
Secondly, he struggles to organize the reservations as they record every booking on paper. As his restaurant is flourishing, it is getting difficult for him to manage all the reservations and cancellations. 
Third, at the moment, he manages both his employer information on paper which requires him to spend hours to manage his business. There are some people that already left the restaurant but are still in the list of employees, or new employees that are not being added to his list of employees which causes confusion when operating.
Lastly, he takes orders of reservations on call and records manually as he cannot afford money to employ more than 5 people. He is currently getting help from his wife, but as she is working for another job, he needs to find another way of managing reservations very soon. 

## Proposed Solution
I propose to build a GUI application that addresses the client's needs, keeping future users in mind. A GUI is easy to navigate, making it user-friendly and efficient for all users[^4]. Additionally, the application does not require an internet connection, allowing users to access it anytime they need[^3].
For the development of this tool, I suggest using Python. Python is an open-source programming language, making it accessible for anyone to use, provided it's installed[^6]. It also ensures that the system remains functional and extentional. With Python, future updates and improvements can be implemented without the need for rebuilding applications whole[^7].
To enhance the user experience, I will use KivyMD to create interactive and pleasing interfaces. For storing data, SQLite is the best choice, as it supports a wide range of platforms while keeping the system lightweight and well-organized. Despite the options like CSV files exist, SQLite offers a more efficient and reliable way to manage data[^1]. By combining Python, KivyMD, and SQLite, the solution will function smoothly and meet the client's requirements effectively.
