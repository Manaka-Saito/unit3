# Reflection 

## Q1. What was the most proud moment for you during this project?

The moment that I was proud of is when I was able to solve the error without using any tools after spending hours in SQL and python. Firstly, I was struggling wtih finding the solution 
to debug as I used the exact same way as the coding videos do on online. I had followed the exact same approach as shown in online coding tutorial videos. However, realizing that they do not work,
I decided to refer to the official documentation instead of relying on videos fully. 
This decision helped me understand the code truly rather than just copying what was shown. It made me feel proud when I was able to understand how to handle without relying on online.   

## Q2. What worked well this time?

  In this project, I was able to manage the database. I was able to understand how to manage the database properly, allowing me to develop the project to satisfy
  the success criteria well, which is to develop the function where application can deal with deletion and addition to the table displayed on the screen by accessing the database and updating
  it correctly.

## Q3. What will I do different for P.4 and the IA?

  I will change my time management on the project. In this project, I spent most of time working on my code which resulted in less focus on the documentation than I should have. 
  For project unit 4, I would finish my code a week before the submission and work on the documentation for the whole week so that I would be able to fully focus on the documentation, especially
  the Criterion C. 

## Q4. What are 3 (or more) things that I need help with.

  1. I need more help with how to code more efficient or how to find the area of improvement in my code using techniques. In this unit, I used Youtube the find the tutorials and examples, but since many of them were published years ago which often uses the functions that are not available in kivyMd anymore.
     Therefore, I would appreciate the help with having the source where I can know the resources to use more.
  2. I need more help with the terminology to use in the documentaiton. Since I am lost in use of language, I struggles with especially writing Criterion C, explaining the functionality of the code. I would appreciate more help with these langauge use and terminology.
  3. I need more help with the justification on the proposed solution. Since I haven't learned which language or tools are the best for developing applications or what other options are there. I struggle to find the proper alternatives and compare then with the one I used to write in the justification of proposed solution.
